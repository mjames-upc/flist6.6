very, very faint malt and hop aroma, and a strong mineral character makes it come across very literally like mineral water.  has some faint white bread malt notes and subtle lemon and dried grass hop aroma.  high carbonation also resembles mineral water.  lemon oil hop flavor; medium to low bitterness; light dish soap esters; ample calcium carbonation; bracing combination of high effervescence and malt roughness.  off-dry with medium bitterness.  no overt off note, just very, very plain and near-flavorless.",,8423,3718,'2013-05-23 00:00:00'

Dunkles naturtrüb kellerbier.
Beautiful sea foam off-white head atop a gorgeously hazy chestnut-colored body.
Cookie-ish malty aroma of baked bread, spiced apples, cinnamon, toast, caramel.
Hoppy and juicy in a mandarin orange / maraschino cherry way.
Rich, sweet malt showing great firmness throughout.
Creamy, soft, filling carbonation.
Wonderfully expressive with no noticeable brewing flaws.
Bread crusts, tangy apricot / tangerine / mandarin orange hop flavors
Very juicy, very soft and very luscious. Fantastic-looking pour.
A favorite from the fest.  Yeastier than most dunkles kellerbier, but the flavor and aroma are so vibrant and expressive, and the malt texture is ridiculously soft.  In the kellerbier you could see they were close, and I was probably harsher in my rating there than I should be, given the noticeable difference between kegs one day versus the next.

2013 update: I’ve had it old now from a shameless bar in San Diego.  I hear some bars sit on it for 3-6 months.  It needs to be fresh, just like the helles, marzen and wheat.

Surprisingly hazy for a hell, seemingly naturtrüb which would put this one in with zwickelbier, though I no clue if they filter the bottles. Bright, vibrant splat hop nose of lemon and pepper with a satisfying and rich hay / cracker / grain cleanliness.  Looks, smells and tastes like zwickelpils; substantially hoppier than you expect from helles, but this is Franconia so calling something a hell does not imply an intended fit to the Munich Helles style. Juicy lemon citrus, creamy carbonation, quenching acidity, mostly dry soft malt body.  I could say the nose is a bit quiet at first, but with cold beer in a cold mug there’s not much to get.  With the glass heated under a warm water faucet, the aroma becomes much more expressive, the juicy hops jump to life and there’s no hint of any off-notes. With German beer much of the time a crapshoot it is nice to find these beers in good shape at a festival.   The Zwickelbier in the bottle last year was disappointing, and the dunkel served along side the Hell was in poor shape.",,77943,8219,'2013-06-13 00:00:00'

Clear gold with a tall white head and thick, foamy lacing.  Exceptionally clean and rich pilsner malt aroma of just-baked crackers with vibrant German hop expression (lemon balm, flowers, dandelions, cirus oils). This is the filtered Zwickelpils, and just as with Gaenstaller’s two versions, I much prefer the one with less yeast.  Medium bitterness  well-suited for body and sweetness.  Rich throughout, and as it breathes with some time the malt becomes a little oxidized (more cracker-y and crunchy and sour smelling), while the hops become more bright and sharp.   I was pretty much blown away by both this and the unfiltered version.  On draft here it was seductively soft and very, very expressive.

5,"Simply put: the cleanest, purest and most vibrant expression of pilsner malt  and spalt and hallertauer hops that exists in the world.  Nobody else even comes close.  Andy’s work is on an entirely different level!

Minerallic calcium carbonate excitement.
Juicy floral lemon hop aroma.
Pure ecstasy of pilsner malt: warm, aromatic baked cracker richness.
Unbelievably clean.
Smacking, quenching acidity, perfectly matched for body, carbonation and sweetness.

Unequivocal perfection in beer, a work of art - a masterpiece - made by the best brewer in the world.  Literally flawless. I find nothing here to improve or change - the malt is unbelievably soft, and the carbonation and serving temperature spot on. And the texture, the texture is what KILLS... malt has never been expressed with such perfect richness, and hops with such juiciness and succulence. Even at room temperature it still exudes perfection.  I had previously given this beer a 3.5 - objectively - at Akkurat.  I now raise it to 5.0 - also objectively - after having it multiple times from a keg brought to the Zoiglstube.  It’s a fragile beer that doesn’t travel well, and when put in the hands of someone else for serving, you surely will not experience it in this state of perfection.  For anyone who loves lagers made without compromise, they owe themselves a visit to Franconia to track down this gem.  It’s the only beer that Andy filters, and by doing so he has allowed pilsner malt and German hops to shine like they never have before.
Words can not do it justice. This beer transcends life. There is beauty here that I’ve never seen before in beer. ",,162657,12331,'2013-05-31 00:00:00'
5,"Pulled from the tanks at 4 weeks at Ganstaller-Brau.  The image of Andreas hunched over and pulling from the bottom of the tank as smoked zoigl spits out everywhere is one I will cherish and enjoy laughing about forever. The body is moderately hazy, approaching cloudy, with a tall, lasting fine-bubbled white head.  It was being lagered at around 40F so after letting it warm a bit it turns into a magical aromatic blossom of dried cut grass / hay / floral hops, honey-drizzled biscuit pilsner malt and floral / wheat / dandelion yeast esters with a incredibly delicate and appropriately restrained smoke character (which comes across as some sort of smoked or just-charred / singed / toasted grain husks or wheat, with just a touch of pig flesh) that integrates with the aforementioned hop, pale malt and yeast aromas.  It’s fucking devine.  The grain bill is only something like 10-15% smoked malt (or less, I can’t remember), so resulting smoke character is smartly held back in this way to allow the synergistic result of mild smoke, delicate noble hops, perfectly-attenuated pilsner malt biscuity-ness (yes that’s a word) and quiet, floral yeast to play a fucking orchestra to your senses.  Astonishingly balanced dryness for the body, but still hints at honey sweetness throughout. Superbly light, pillowly, creamy and silky carbonation (natural, from the tank!), the result is a sort-of merging of traditional Bavarian styles, Zoigl and Rauch, but with the touch and care of perhaps the best brewer in Germany.

I want to be a critic and find something about this I don’t like but it’s very difficult.  I could maybe give this anywhere between a 4.4 to 4.8, but in that range you can’t pick apart what separates one from another, rather for me it’s about where it ranks in your beer drinking life experiences.  that said, this has to be the best zoiglbier in Germany. I went into this with TAR and Ernest’s impressions fresh and I’m always careful to be aware of bais from that sort of exposure, and usually I’m more of a critic if other folks recently have &quot;wow&quot; moments with something, but this really is it.

Yeast is subtly rich and provides good lushness and creaminess (along with the superbly soft carbonation). Sticky pale malt and yeast phenols combine to form a pineapple dandelion and lemon oil bouquet. Sweet but never overbearing. Exceptionally soft, rich and creamy malt texture with a satisfyingly sharp bounce in the finish - crisp, smacking, quenching.  Overall a wonderful heller bock that is stacked with complexity.

First go: Lightly fruity, somewhat musty, green, raw hop aroma.  Cocoa / chocolate.  Rich mouthfeel, explosive carbonation and bitterness and hop acids in the finish. Very fragrant but also more muddled / yeasty than the keg pours a week later.

Second go: Amazingly fruity / grapefruit American hop nose.  Rich cocoa and chocolate malt and roast, a lot of enticing dark caramel malt sugars.  Cleanly fermented.  Roast is earthy bitter baking chocolate.  Dangerously drinkable alcohol.  Glorious.  Something like a strong Black IPA crossed with a doppelbock, and more American in character than German.


12oz bottle at Andy’s brewery, August 2014.  Approximately 18 months old. Short tan colored head on a dark chestnut brown body.
It has lost the bright hop nose given by the intense dry-hopping, and the luscious chocolate and roast-focused malt has taken over the aroma.  Creamy, silky body.  Sweet balanced enough by bitterness.

Minerallic and sweet, the body is lighter than is typical for Gänstaller, but it’s still delightfully soft with no huskiness or coarseness noticed. Balanced bitterness and a minerallic touch of Franconian hard water give it a salivating though restrained acidity. Toasted grain / bread crusts, sugar cookie, red apple skin / maraschino cherry / mild tropical fruits, the aforementioned smoke character.... quite a brilliant display of aroma and flavor.

4.1,"Draft at Fränkisches Bierfest in Nürnberg, after having a yeasty sample from the lagering vessel a week and a half before.
In the morning the keg was muddy and hazy so there wasn’t much to get out of it other than raw American hop tropical fruit / bubble gum and an earthy / muddy yeast character.  Alcohol is never apparent, not in the nose, flavor, finish or burps, but I think the keg tapped today was probably around 8-8.5% with some time before the beer reaches 9.5%.  Later in the day the keg was settled and Romator was pouring clearer, similar in appearance to the Kellerbier that had been pouring each day.  Has a TON of citra / high-alpha grapefruit / tropical fruit / bubble gum hop notes on top of a subtle smoked ham / pig back fat rauch malt savoriness.  Centennial hops give it a tea and pine character.  Citra gives it a lot of tropical fruit bubble gum.  Simcoe, I think is in there, from the slight green onion / shallot twang. And the last American hop I think is Columbus, is herbal, fruity, floral and very acidic.   Creamy, low carbonation, sweet, full mouthfeel, bitter, Double IPA-ish rauch heller bock something. So a little bit like back bacon and pineapple pizza. I am not a fan of Citra hops at all, they are disgustingly bubble gummy and estery and fake-smelling, but in this beer they work because the master has a touch, and even an absurd-for-Germany smoked India Pale Lager is done probably the best that anyone could do.  And yet this is the only one.  So that says something too about Andreas Gaenstaller.  He’s only the greatest brewer of his generation.",,215249,12331,'2013-06-15 00:00:00'

Andy mentioned it was a bit old, starting to oxidize, but that he still liked the citra hop character.  and yeah, the hop character was remarkable. so this is a double IPA recipe brewed with bottom-fermenting yeast and lagered for 6 weeks (I think).  so if it doesn’t fit with Double IPA, it surely doesn’t fit with &quot;Imperial Pilsner&quot; - so I moved it to Zwickel/Keller/Landbier because it’s a) German b) unfiltered, c) hop-focused, d) hard to fit anywhere else.  it’s mosty American citra with some German hops in the mix, but all German malt.  the nose is RIDICULOSULY luscious - very much like fresh, dank weed with a strong lemon oil and herbal / vegetal character.  medium body  with creamy and rich frothing carbonation, washing the tongue with resinous alpha acids and leaving a sticky red /dark malt (doughy bread crust, toasted grain) coating in the mouth. bright, sharp hop acids are tempered by magically soft malt, though slightly oxidized (a little too much wet cardboard and soggy bread), it’s still in great shape.

3.6,"Sampled from two kegs in the cooler of Ganstaller-Brau. the plan apparently was to let it sit for 1-2 years in steel (tanks, with some pulled off to keg like these) before transferring to oak barrels for an additional year.  However the state of Quator at this time (November 2011) was not so good and Andreas mentioned that plans to further age in oak have been scrapped and he’ll brew another batch and try again.  The two kegs we sampled were both acidic, tart and mildly &quot;infected’ in a very general sense.  I leave it to the brewer to speculate as to how this happened given the beer never touched oak, a point of confusion early on when the future aging in oak was lost in translation and I was under the impression the samples I had already spent time on oak and thus the acid and bacteria character.  That all said, it wasn’t a monstrous infection, though certainly not mild; it was well-above the taste threshold of (I have to assume) acetic acid.  Flavor is moderately sweet toasted grains, plum / black cherry fruit, oxidized caramel malt / cardboard / wet wood.  Body is rich, chewy and full, carbonation is balanced to the weight and sweetness of the beer and froths appropriately across the middle and back.  One keg was moderately tart / sour (in a plain yogurt-almost-sour-cream way) with mild acidity (red wine vinegar, black pepper phenols, slightly metallic) while the other was mildly tart and sour with less acidity than the first but had the same character as the first (red wine vinegar, etc).  For sure a shame that it didn’t turn out as intended, but still enjoyable and delicious and certainly not in such bad shape that the underlying effort can’t be appreciated.  So here are my notes for the sake of completeness, and I’ll certainly make an effort to get over and try the next batch of Quator to revise my review here.",,134719,12331,'2011-12-04 00:00:00'

2.4,"Bottle from the brewery. Lightly hazed gold with a medium-sized white head.
Impression of the nose is stale banana slices, muted clove esters, yeast with a quier salt and pepper effect. Light bodied and effervescent. Dry, pasty, starchy, tart and turning sour with a rough dose of yeast in the finish. Off balance and unpalatable. ",,19027,3147,'2014-09-27 00:00:00'
2,"Bottle from the brewery. Starch and cement mix and shaved carrot / DMS off-notes muck up the aroma, covering up faint lemon juice hoppiness. Highly effervescent, gritty and husky, semi-sweet (lower perception given the high carbonation), bitterness seems low. Stinky acetone becomes unbearable after a short time. Had to spit instead of swallow.",,281853,3147,'2014-09-27 00:00:00'
2.8,"Draft at the brewery in Reckendorf, November 2012. Lightly hazed dull amber with a fine white head. Yeasty aroma with dry pet food mix malt and faint pepper hop aromatics. Medium-light body, semi-sweet, apple-y and caramel-focused with a short, lightly bitter finish. The yeast seems to muddle the entire thing, but what’s there is dull anyways.

2.6,"Bottle from the brewery best by February 2015. Clear orange amber with a short white head. Toasty and nutty butter toffee malt-focused aroma with off-notes of pet dander, fabric, copper pennies. Faint herbal hop aroma. Medium-light body is semi-sweet with light to moderate bitterness and relatively low acidity leaving it flabby on the tongue. Low spritz of carbonation froths quickly leaving a syrupy, filmy short finish. Basic nutty / toffee malt with little hoppiness offered. Pretty poor compared to the brightness and quenching acidity of the Pilsner.",,40777,5346,'2014-11-10 00:00:00'
3.7,"Draft at the brewery. Hazy caramel brown with a tall and lasting off-white head. Airy minerals and toasted grain / grist nose; bright and sharp aroma hops are lemon oil and pepper, spicy like tettnanger, complimenting the strong cereal malt character, though it’s just barely wort-y / raw. The hoppiness grows as it warms, becoming one of the hoppier dunkels I’ve had. Crisp and lightly chewy in the mouth, semi-sweet, moderately bitter, medium body, bready with a toasty core. Brash carbonation and heavy minerals amplify the faint malt roughness. Highly caramelized, which is enjoyable, if only the carbonation was finer and the roughness worked out.

3.5,"Draft at the brewery. Hazy caramel brown with a tall and lasting off-white head. Exactly the same color, opacity and head retention as the dunkel. Creamy, soft and sweet in the mouth, savory and filling, transitioning to a dry, peppery finish. Pleasant malt toffee / bread character, lighter bitterness and quieter aroma hops than the dunkel. Sulfur and faint game-y notes show up as it breathes and warms and there is a faint hint of butter. Pepper-spice-citrus oil hops show up as it breathes but still lighter expression than the dunkel’s hoppiness. Minerally, and very Franconia in character. Maltier, sweeter, nutty-toasty-spicy in the way of cardamom bread. You could tell me this was Zoiglbier and I wouldn’t blink. Long savory finish becomes a little wort-like. The balance is enjoyable, expression is above average.",,78896,8970,'2014-11-10 00:00:00'
2.9,"Draft at the brewery. Effervescent lightly hazed gold with a tall and lasting white head. Intense fruit candy aroma (gummy bears, bubble gum, pineapple sorbet, peach slices, apricot jelly), very out of character for pilsner, certainly non-traditional, and doesn’t stand out as the signature Cascade apricot / mandarin orange character at all. Medium-light body, sweet with relatively high acidity, carbonic acid cutting the sugar well, but still it tastes like artificial fruit candies with a heavy dose of white grape and candied pineapple (the white gummi bear note is remarkably odd).",,298367,8970,'2014-11-10 00:00:00'
3.3,"Bottle best by July 2015. Clear gold with a fine white head. Hop-forward aroma shows green noble hops as lemon-pepper, celery seed and grass, while malt is quiet cookie batter and toast. Medium body, slick and oily and viscous in the mouth. Semi-sweet, fine carbonation gives it proper creaminess while hop bitterness is strong but still balanced against sugar. Quite good shape out of the bottle, clean, hoppy, creamy and soft in texture.

2.6,"From draft at the brewery in Kulmbach. Hazed copper with a fine off-white head. Toasty, bready, cereal-heavy, nutty malt aroma with touches of candy apple amber malt and faint yeast doughiness. Lightly hoppy apricot jam and herbs. Medium body, sweet, rough in the mouth, medium-low bitterness. Acidic and yeasty and dirty in the mouth.

Malty aroma of candy sugar, pale malt honey pastries, hops are faint peach, faint off-notes of detergent, plastic and cauliflower (DMS), which sounds bad but again, it’s a mild off-aroma.

Clean, malty pilsner with medium bitterness, lightly spicy / peppery, low citrus / lemon quality, more similar to low-hopped Pilsner or Helles.

Sweet, medium body, rich and savory in the mouth, measured bitterness and medium acidity. Remarkably long and savory malt finish peppered by restrained noble hop bitterness. Juicy, sweet and clean, full of savory, filling melanoidins.

Aroma shows Pilsner malt well as baked baguette and saltine cracker with faint noble aroma hops as grass, lemon zest and celery seed.

Medium body, sweet approach turning watery and thin in a short finish that resembles malzbier: cola flavoring, plum sugar, mild solvent and metal flake.

Really fucking delicious when it settles a bit after pouring... not Franconian in character, and closer to ale than lager given the phenolic quality, but it has a lot in common with highly crusty / toasty dunkles and amber lager.

Malty is honey-ish, doughy, baguette like, minimal hop aroma seems washed out by the yeast, but it’s lightly hopped anyway, only showing a faint apricot jam hoppiness after is warms.

Well-made, balanced and drinkable, but tough to say if it would be a truly great Pilsner with so much yeast still in solution.

3.8,"Draft at Hölzlein. Clear dark honey with a firm white head. Burnt honey maltiness, rich and spicy, clean with lip smacking crispness. Medium-full body, sweet with medium bitterness. Slight tinge of roasted nut oils in a lengthy finish. Body is nicely rich, carbonation decently soft, mineral character invigorating. Well-balanced, clean, expressive.",,190596,4866,'2014-11-18 00:00:00'
4.4,"Draft at Meinel Brau in Hof. Lightly hazed pale gold with a stiff and fine white head. Beauty of a nose showing Noble hops well: flowers, lemon oil, lively citric acid, faint doughiness with more mineral / chalk character than the filtered Pilsner. Hoppy and zesty and lively, juicy and oily in the mouth, off-dry with fine, creamy carbonation and quenching hop acidity. Superbly elegant. ",,62862,4143,'2014-11-25 00:00:00'
3.7,"Draft at Meinel Brau in Hof. Clear pale gold with a fine white head. Lemon-y and minerallic and balanced, it’s less expressive in the nose than the Zwickelpils, but is noticeably &quot;cleaner&quot; in it’s lemon oil Noble hop presentation. Lightly sweet, medium-low bitterness, juicy and hoppy with a trace off-note of laundry detergent. Has good malt richness but the carbonation is just a tad fizzy / rough.

3.9,"From gravity barrel at Brauerei Gradl. Unfiltered but clear with a chestnut brown color and fine, lasting tan head.
Malty and mineral-heavy aroma with subtle noble hoppiness (floral lemon, grass). Clean as can be with wonderfully toasty / bready / crunchy cereal malt profile, traces of cola flavoring and something that’s almost like vanilla bean. Semi sweet, mineral-forward lip smacking immensely long finish of lingering pepper-spice hop bitterness.",,38325,5109,'2014-11-23 00:00:00'
3.6,"Draft at Antlabrau in Kronach. Opaque milky white body with a fine white head. Muddy yeast in the nose covering an otherwise German noble hop aroma, your lemon and apricot character. Medium-light body, semi-dry with medium+ bitterness, more acidic that it should be with so much yeast in solution. Pilsner malt is nicely bready and toasty and carbonic acid pleasantly quenching.",,129384,12016,'2014-11-23 00:00:00'
3.5,"Draft at the brewery in Kronach. Clear chestnut brown with ruby tones. Clean aroma and flavor, nutty and crusty maltiness with good mineral content. Medium bodied, nicely carbonic and fluffy in the mouth, lightly sweet with low bitterness. Lengthy dark malt bread crust finish and faint resemblance to cola flavoring. Not the most expressive but easily drinkable.",,129385,12016,'2014-11-23 00:00:00'
2.6,"Bottle best by January 2015. Clear rust colored body with a thin ring of a white head. Oxidized amber malt aroma is metal and cardboard with red apple skin and cinnamon candies. Light body, semi-sweet with low bitterness in a watery, thin finish. Starchy and papery more than anything.",,38195,5081,'2014-11-15 00:00:00'
2.6,"Bottle best by March 2015. Clear gold with a fine white head. Quiet pale malt biscuit / cracker aroma with little to no aroma hop expression. Medium body, silty / chalky rough acidity, lightly sweet with medium bitterness. There’s some decent malt body but flavor-wise it’s basically empty. Very dull. Faint lemon noble hops mixed with quiet cauliflower DMS.",,19498,3206,'2014-11-15 00:00:00'
3.3,"From draft at Kellerwald, Forchheim. Quiet nose of minerals and fabric and stone. Creamy soft carb
Mineralic, lightly toasty, clean, just sweet, hop profile is subtle lemon and grass hops, enjoyable but without depth.
Semi-sweet, low to moderate hoppiness. Long finish of dried grass and pale malt (cracker, saccharine). It’s in nice shape, but the body is a tad watery and after some times the malt begins to show apple-y notes, but that could just be me.",,33471,2797,'2014-09-08 00:00:00'

2.7,"Bottle best by April 2015. Clear amber gold. Aroma is spiced honey, lemon oil, cinnamon, faint alcohol. Medium-full body, rich carbonation froth up front breaks and dissolves quickly. Semi-sweet with lasting melanoidin richness, but the character is a little raw, resembling corn syrup more than malt. Faint fusels and metal flake off-notes.",,130155,2949,'2014-11-15 00:00:00'
2.6,"Bottle best by January 2015. Clear bronze with a small white head.
Fruity apple esters and burnt grain maltiness is raw and unpleasant. Little to no aromatic hops. Chewy medium-full sugary body, lightly bitter, faint off-notes of ash, concrete mix / gravel and DMS, the last two having become standard from Kundmüller. ",,272876,1822,'2014-09-18 00:00:00'
4.1,"Bottle. Aggressive aroma hops fight against rich truffle-like malt with blackberry, currant and juniper berry undertones. Fine, silky carbonation on a full and rich, seemingly dry body, leading to sharp, overpowering bitterness in a long finish. The first two times I was enamored, the bitterness seems well-integrated and the mouthfeel was like eating a soft high % cocoa Belgian truffle. But the third try seemed too much to take, I found myself sensitive to the 90 IBUs and wishing for brighter malt expression.",,291123,12331,'2014-11-27 00:00:00'
4.1,"Bottle. Mostly clear honey gold with a fine white head. Richly aromatic meaty ham hock rauch character, fatty and juicy and reminding of honey glazed ham. American aroma hops are bright lemon / citrus, somewhat tropical. Peat smoked malt provides a brine-like earthiness that integrates well. Medium-full body, spicy, peppery, sharp in the mouth. Enjoyably meaty, honey-ish and rich. Sweet, sticky, spicy and clean.",,291154,12331,'2014-11-27 00:00:00'
3.6,"From keg. Opaque golden amber with a fine white head. Intensely fruity / tropical American hop nose shows unripe banana, pineapple candies, guava. Little in the way of esters and little malt to be noticed in the aroma, the wheat can’t stand out against the strong aroma hops. Highly sweet with medium bitterness and relatively low acidity. Fine carbonation and creamy mouthfeel from the wheat delivers a silky and velvety textural experience. Lengthy sweet finish, for those with a sweet tooth they might find an entire glass fitting for dessert, but for me the sweetness becomes fatiguing after a small amount. Still, it’s a fun hop experience, fermentation is clean with no noticeable alcohol. Objectively, the character says &quot;Double IPA&quot; rather than Weizen-doppelbock.
",,291122,12331,'2014-11-12 00:00:00'
3.5,"Bottle. The spelt character seems to clash with the fruity American hops, giving the aroma the character of herbal spirits, juniper, wood oil, etc., in addition to the tropical citrus notes. Rich and full bodied, sweet with moderate bitterness, defying the stated 85 IBU. Silky, fine carbonation with a lengthy finish. The Amarillo doesn’t stand out as resin and grapefruit, rather the hop profile seems more minty / green. It’s a little too sugary-sweet for my tastes, and the Spelt character I can’t get into since it smells and tastes like gin, and I can’t stand anything gin-flavored. ",,294377,12331,'2014-11-27 00:00:00'
3.2,"Quick-bottled sample.  Mostly clear dark reddish-brown hue.  Strong American bourbon aroma.  Pine nuts, dark fruits, candied bourbon cherries, cognac.  Full body.   Big, sticky malt sugar approach.  Drying but still-sweet, dusty, nutty, somewhat hot finish. It drinks well as a digestif.  If you’re going to make a 14% bourbon barrel doppelbock-sortof beer on your first try, this is a pretty fine effort.  I always like trying Andreas’ new experiments, but I think his low gravity, German-hopped beers are his finest work.",,291799,12331,'2013-06-15 00:00:00'
3.6,"As Hell from gravity barrel at Schaufel, Kellerwald.
Semi-sweet with faint mustiness (sulfur, calcium), Noble hops give their signature lemon-herb character. Malt is clean, bready / doughy (not yeasty). Medium body. Creamy carbonation, hoppy and bitter. You could convince me I was drinking the Ungespundetes Lagerbier instead.

3.2,"Gravity barrel Ungespundet at the brewery in Bamberg, August 2014. Malt is grainy / raw grape nuts cereal, hops are bright orange-apricot marmalade. Medium-light body, low carb, somewhat syrupy with seemingly low bitterness. It’s a little flabby but the low carbonation is expected, no outright problems, decent flavor balance. It’s an easy quaffer but there’s not a lot of depth.",,5095,898,'2014-09-21 00:00:00'
3.4,"From bottle dated best by February 2015. Clear cola brown body with a short off-white head.
Mostly clean dark cola malt nose with a touch of char. Bready and toasty just enough but it still smells more like syrup than something directly coaxed from the grain. Medium body, low bitterness, medium-low acidity, soft and chewy, semi-sweet, a little savory, lightly smoke-y / meaty, some intensifying bread crust character in the finish. Interesting nose, goes between a 6 and 7 for me. The malt is a little simple and generic but the faint char / meat character gives it some life.",,21276,3404,'2014-09-23 00:00:00'
2.8,"Bottle best by April 2015. Clear honey gold with a white head. Quiet nose of biscuit and baked apple pale malt and faint floral-lemon Noble hops Medium body, sweet and starchy and slightly boozy, showing green apple off-notes and a corn syrup twang. Funny that the nose doesn’t hint at the mess of flavors. Silty approach turning syrupy across the middle. Bitterness blends in with the starch character.

faint mineral / gravel touches to the aroma with a light peppercorn spice hop note. light-flavor centers on toasty, slightly-sweet cracker / biscuit malt with softer touches of corn syrup sweetness. has a moderate hop bitterness and expert cleanliness, but comes across almost more like a hoppy helles than a German pilsner given the grain syrupiness and sweetness.  that said, it’s delicious and quenching.",,35296,4821,'2012-12-24 00:00:00'

Nose of old red apples, slightly moldly and dank, with some toasted corn, toasted barley, and a light sweet honeycrisp apple note.
