Surprisingly hazy for a hell, seemingly naturtrüb which would put this one in with zwickelbier, though I no clue if they filter the bottles. Bright, vibrant splat hop nose of lemon and pepper with a satisfying and rich hay / cracker / grain cleanliness.  Looks, smells and tastes like zwickelpils; substantially hoppier than you expect from helles, but this is Franconia so calling something a hell does not imply an intended fit to the Munich Helles style. Juicy lemon citrus, creamy carbonation, quenching acidity, mostly dry soft malt body.  I could say the nose is a bit quiet at first, but with cold beer in a cold mug there’s not much to get.  With the glass heated under a warm water faucet, the aroma becomes much more expressive, the juicy hops jump to life and there’s no hint of any off-notes. With German beer much of the time a crapshoot it is nice to find these beers in good shape at a festival.

2.9,"Update in 2014: this brewery just keeps getting worse.  What used to be stunning is now faulty.  My first time having the pils I put it at 4.4, it was clean and expressive without a fault to be found.  The next year it was 3.7-level, and now in 2014 it’s a 2.5 DMS bomb of a beer that smells like vegetables.  I think the brewery just doesn’t care.  My thoughts are shared by industry professionals in the area.

Clear gold with a tall white head and thick, foamy lacing.  Exceptionally clean and rich pilsner malt aroma of just-baked crackers with vibrant German hop expression &#40;lemon balm, flowers, dandelions, cirus oils&#41;. This is the filtered Zwickelpils, and just as with Gaenstaller’s two versions, I much prefer the one with less yeast.  Medium bitterness  well-suited for body and sweetness.  Rich throughout, and as it breathes with some time the malt becomes a little oxidized &#40;more cracker-y and crunchy and sour smelling&#41;, while the hops become more bright and sharp.   I was pretty much blown away by both this and the unfiltered version.  On draft here it was seductively soft and very, very expressive.  The Original in the bottle was over-carbonated, minerally and rough. &#40;3.5-3.8/5.0&#41;.",,187490,15335,'6/13/2013 00:00:00'

5,"Simply put: the cleanest, purest and most vibrant expression of pilsner malt  and spalt and hallertauer hops that exists in the world.  Nobody else even comes close.  Andy’s work is on an entirely different level&#033;

Minerallic calcium carbonate excitement.<br />
Juicy floral lemon hop aroma.<br />
Pure ecstasy of pilsner malt: warm, aromatic baked cracker richness.<br />
Unbelievably clean.<br />
Smacking, quenching acidity, perfectly matched for body, carbonation and sweetness.
<br /><br />
Unequivocal perfection in beer, a work of art - a masterpiece - made by the best brewer in the world.  Literally flawless. I find nothing here to improve or change - the malt is unbelievably soft, and the carbonation and serving temperature spot on. And the texture, the texture is what KILLS... malt has never been expressed with such perfect richness, and hops with such juiciness and succulence. Even at room temperature it still exudes perfection.  I had previously given this beer a 3.5 - objectively - at Akkurat.  I now raise it to 5.0 - also objectively - after having it multiple times from a keg brought to the Zoiglstube.  It’s a fragile beer that doesn’t travel well, and when put in the hands of someone else for serving, you surely will not experience it in this state of perfection.  For anyone who loves lagers made without compromise, they owe themselves a visit to Franconia to track down this gem.  It’s the only beer that Andy filters, and by doing so he has allowed pilsner malt and German hops to shine like they never have before. <br /><br />
Words can not do it justice. This beer transcends life. There is beauty here that I’ve never seen before in beer. ",,162657,12331,'5/31/2013 00:00:00'
5,"Pulled from the tanks at 4 weeks at Ganstaller-Brau.  The image of Andreas hunched over and pulling from the bottom of the tank as smoked zoigl spits out everywhere is one I will cherish and enjoy laughing about forever. The body is moderately hazy, approaching cloudy, with a tall, lasting fine-bubbled white head.  It was being lagered at around 40F so after letting it warm a bit it turns into a magical aromatic blossom of dried cut grass / hay / floral hops, honey-drizzled biscuit pilsner malt and floral / wheat / dandelion yeast esters with a incredibly delicate and appropriately restrained smoke character &#40;which comes across as some sort of smoked or just-charred / singed / toasted grain husks or wheat, with just a touch of pig flesh&#41; that integrates with the aforementioned hop, pale malt and yeast aromas.  It’s fucking devine.  The grain bill is only something like 10-15% smoked malt &#40;or less, I can’t remember&#41;, so resulting smoke character is smartly held back in this way to allow the synergistic result of mild smoke, delicate noble hops, perfectly-attenuated pilsner malt biscuity-ness &#40;yes that’s a word&#41; and quiet, floral yeast to play a fucking orchestra to your senses.  Astonishingly balanced dryness for the body, but still hints at honey sweetness throughout. Superbly light, pillowly, creamy and silky carbonation &#40;natural, from the tank&#033;&#41;, the result is a sort-of merging of traditional Bavarian styles, Zoigl and Rauch, but with the touch and care of perhaps the best brewer in Germany.

4.7,"draft at the zoiglstube.  normally on every friday but the friday i show up, but pulled from a keg in the back by Andreas.  hugely hoppy nose: prickly, green, grassy, zesty.  yeast must, hop oils, honey biscuit malt, fruity orange, lemon and melon notes, zingy green hop flavor.  honey biscuits and just-toasted grains... wow. it’s musty but completely soft; rustic and yeasty with noble hops as bright as they have ever been. floral yogurt is there at times with zingy, bright acid and bitterness, neither of which even approach brash or harsh or excessively out of balance.  I want to be a critic and find something about this I don’t like but it’s very difficult.  I could maybe give this anywhere between a 4.4 to 4.8, but in that range you can’t pick apart what separates one from another, rather for me it’s about where it ranks in your beer drinking life experiences.  that said, this has to be the best zoiglbier in Germany. I went into this with TAR and Ernest’s impressions fresh and I’m always careful to be aware of bais from that sort of exposure, and usually I’m more of a critic if other folks recently have &quot;wow&quot; moments with something, but this really is it.  I’ve been through Bavaria twice before this trip and I’ve been trying as much zoigl as I can, and this one is otherworldly. ",,105521,12331,'12/2/2011 00:00:00'

Sticky pale malt and yeast phenols combine to form a pineapple dandelion and lemon oil bouquet. Sweet but never overbearing. Exceptionally soft, rich and creamy malt texture with a satisfyingly sharp bounce in the finish - crisp, smacking, quenching.  Overall a wonderful heller bock that is stacked with complexity.

Chewy, sweet toffee malts and cherry and plum flavored malt sugars.  Clean fermentation.  Creamy carbonation.  Ebbing and flowing and swelling aroma.

<b>First go:</b> Lightly fruity, somewhat musty, green, raw hop aroma.  Cocoa / chocolate.  Rich mouthfeel, explosive carbonation and bitterness and hop acids in the finish. Very fragrant but also more muddled / yeasty than the keg pours a week later.
<br />
<b>Second go:</b> Amazingly fruity / grapefruit American hop nose.  Rich cocoa and chocolate malt and roast, a lot of enticing dark caramel malt sugars.  Cleanly fermented.  Roast is earthy bitter baking chocolate.  Dangerously drinkable alcohol.  Glorious.  Something like a strong Black IPA crossed with a doppelbock, and more American in character than German.

12oz bottle at Andy’s brewery, August 2014.  Approximately 18 months old. Short tan colored head on a dark chestnut brown body.<br />
It has lost the bright hop nose given by the intense dry-hopping, and the luscious chocolate and roast-focused malt has taken over the aroma.  Creamy, silky body.  Sweet balanced enough by bitterness.

Minerallic and sweet, the body is lighter than is typical for Gänstaller, but it’s still delightfully soft with no huskiness or coarseness noticed. Balanced bitterness and a minerallic touch of Franconian hard water give it a salivating though restrained acidity. Toasted grain / bread crusts, sugar cookie, red apple skin / maraschino cherry / mild tropical fruits, the aforementioned smoke character.... quite a brilliant display of aroma and flavor. Seems in the approach too sweet for it’s size but, no surprise, the finish shows outstanding balance. Reddish amber body with a fine white head.

4.1,"Draft at Fränkisches Bierfest in Nürnberg, after having a yeasty sample from the lagering vessel a week and a half before.<br />
In the morning the keg was muddy and hazy so there wasn’t much to get out of it other than raw American hop tropical fruit / bubble gum and an earthy / muddy yeast character.  Alcohol is never apparent, not in the nose, flavor, finish or burps, but I think the keg tapped today was probably around 8-8.5% with some time before the beer reaches 9.5%.  Later in the day the keg was settled and Romator was pouring clearer, similar in appearance to the Kellerbier that had been pouring each day.  Has a TON of citra / high-alpha grapefruit / tropical fruit / bubble gum hop notes on top of a subtle smoked ham / pig back fat rauch malt savoriness.  Centennial hops give it a tea and pine character.  Citra gives it a lot of tropical fruit bubble gum.  Simcoe, I think is in there, from the slight green onion / shallot twang. And the last American hop I think is Columbus, is herbal, fruity, floral and very acidic.   Creamy, low carbonation, sweet, full mouthfeel, bitter, Double IPA-ish rauch heller bock something. So a little bit like back bacon and pineapple pizza. I am not a fan of Citra hops at all, they are disgustingly bubble gummy and estery and fake-smelling, but in this beer they work because the master has a touch, and even an absurd-for-Germany smoked India Pale Lager is done probably the best that anyone could do.  And yet this is the only one.  So that says something too about Andreas Gaenstaller.  He’s only the greatest brewer of his generation.",,215249,12331,'6/15/2013 00:00:00'

Andy mentioned it was a bit old, starting to oxidize, but that he still liked the citra hop character.  and yeah, the hop character was remarkable. so this is a double IPA recipe brewed with bottom-fermenting yeast and lagered for 6 weeks &#40;I think&#41;.  so if it doesn’t fit with Double IPA, it surely doesn’t fit with &quot;Imperial Pilsner&quot; - so I moved it to Zwickel/Keller/Landbier because it’s a&#41; German b&#41; unfiltered, c&#41; hop-focused, d&#41; hard to fit anywhere else.  it’s mosty American citra with some German hops in the mix, but all German malt.  the nose is RIDICULOSULY luscious - very much like fresh, dank weed with a strong lemon oil and herbal / vegetal character.  medium body  with creamy and rich frothing carbonation, washing the tongue with resinous alpha acids and leaving a sticky red /dark malt &#40;doughy bread crust, toasted grain&#41; coating in the mouth. bright, sharp hop acids are tempered by magically soft malt, though slightly oxidized &#40;a little too much wet cardboard and soggy bread&#41;, it’s still in great shape.

3.6,"Sampled from two kegs in the cooler of Ganstaller-Brau. the plan apparently was to let it sit for 1-2 years in steel &#40;tanks, with some pulled off to keg like these&#41; before transferring to oak barrels for an additional year.  However the state of Quator at this time &#40;November 2011&#41; was not so good and Andreas mentioned that plans to further age in oak have been scrapped and he’ll brew another batch and try again.  The two kegs we sampled were both acidic, tart and mildly &quot;infected’ in a very general sense.  I leave it to the brewer to speculate as to how this happened given the beer never touched oak, a point of confusion early on when the future aging in oak was lost in translation and I was under the impression the samples I had already spent time on oak and thus the acid and bacteria character.  That all said, it wasn’t a monstrous infection, though certainly not mild; it was well-above the taste threshold of &#40;I have to assume&#41; acetic acid.  Flavor is moderately sweet toasted grains, plum / black cherry fruit, oxidized caramel malt / cardboard / wet wood.  Body is rich, chewy and full, carbonation is balanced to the weight and sweetness of the beer and froths appropriately across the middle and back.  One keg was moderately tart / sour &#40;in a plain yogurt-almost-sour-cream way&#41; with mild acidity &#40;red wine vinegar, black pepper phenols, slightly metallic&#41; while the other was mildly tart and sour with less acidity than the first but had the same character as the first &#40;red wine vinegar, etc&#41;.  For sure a shame that it didn’t turn out as intended, but still enjoyable and delicious and certainly not in such bad shape that the underlying effort can’t be appreciated.

<br /><br />
From gravity barrel at the brewery in Kemmern. Hazy amber with a patchy off-white head.<br />
Medium body, sweet and syrupy. Low carbonation as expected, but hop acidity and mineral character gives it some foundation, but it’s also yeasty / dirty and the malt comes across as red apple and caramel chews. Dull in the nose, flabby in the mouth. Faint metal off-notes. Pretty poor showing after making our way back to the brewery for a barrel tapping. And odd that the bottle fared better by score, but by memory they are about the same, 2.9-3.3 is not much of a difference, perhaps it was because of expectation.

Sulfur and faint game-y notes show up as it breathes and warms and there is a faint hint of butter. Pepper-spice-citrus oil hops show up as it breathes but still lighter expression than the dunkel’s hoppiness. Minerally, and very Franconia in character.

Quiet floral Hallertau hops showing herbs and citric apricot, combined with clean, savory Pilsner malt &#40;honey and toasty baked baguette&#41;. Medium bodied, sticky, malty and rich in the mouth, sweetness balanced well by carbonation.

Malt is toasty and baguette-like. Medium-light body, lightly sweet, restrained bitterness, relatively high acidity from the trub. Finish shows orange pulp and silty yeast.

Little in the way of esters and little malt to be noticed in the aroma, the wheat can’t stand out against the strong aroma hops. Highly sweet with medium bitterness and relatively low acidity. Fine carbonation and creamy mouthfeel from the wheat delivers a silky and velvety textural experience. Lengthy sweet finish, for those with a sweet tooth they might find an entire glass fitting for dessert, but for me the sweetness becomes fatiguing after a small amount. Still, it’s a fun hop experience, fermentation is clean with no noticeable alcohol. Objectively, the character says &quot;Double IPA&quot; rather than Weizen-doppelbock.

Rich and full bodied, sweet with moderate bitterness, defying the stated 85 IBU. Silky, fine carbonation with a lengthy finish. The Amarillo doesn’t stand out as resin and grapefruit, rather the hop profile seems more minty / green. It’s a little too sugary-sweet for my tastes, and the Spelt character I can’t get into since it smells and tastes like gin, and I can’t stand anything gin-flavored.

Big, sticky malt sugar approach.  Drying but still-sweet, dusty, nutty, somewhat hot finish. It drinks well as a digestif.  If you’re going to make a 14% bourbon barrel doppelbock-sortof beer on your first try, this is a pretty fine effort.
